=======================
numerical data science 
=======================

int  - holds singed integers 
float - hold floating decimal
complex - hold complex numbers

==============
python casting 
==============

a = 10 <--- integer
b = float(a)

why we use array
>store that data collation -> list, tuple , dictionary (Python only)
>store multiple data
don't include python Array that have only list , tuple , dictionary 

python List is changeable that has ability add , remove and modifying 

in big arrays you can easily get the last element by using -1 index


32, "apple", "Grapes", "rabbit", "rat"

ascending alphanumeric

[0-9] - 1
[A-Z] - 2
[a-z] - 3

list join - combining two list
